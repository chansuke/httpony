# HTTPony

HTTPony (pronounced aych-tee-tee-pony) is a simple HTTP server
that pretty prints HTTP requests to a terminal.
It is a useful aide for developing clients that send HTTP requests.
HTTPony acts as a sink for a client
so that a developer can understand what the client is sending.

This project is heavily inspired by [HTTPie][pie].
Thanks for making a great alternative to cURL.
